Java implementation of Dekker's mutual exclusion algorithm. Just a pocket project to support the teaching of Concurrent Programming to my Computer Science students.

The code represents the 5th and final version of Dekker's algorithm, the one without the known problems of lockstep synchronization (v1) and indefinite postponement (v4).
